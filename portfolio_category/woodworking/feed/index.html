										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a very special project for me as this is a memorial plaque made for my father. He passed away in 2012, and when our family had his memorial service, we scattered his ashes around the cabin which he built by hand for us. As we scattered his ashes we each read a passage from a Native American poem that represents each of the directions of life.</p>
<p>This was my first attempt at inlay. There are 8 different species of wood used in this pieces from quilted maple, to Himalayan cedar. the engraving was filled with fine saw dust rather than paint filled.</p>
<p>This plaque is now permanently hung in the cabin overlooking the red bridge that he built which our company is named after.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a unique project for us. The customer, who is a wedding planner, wanted a large yet portable sign she can use at conventions. Her style was modern country/chic. The size requirement for the sign was a bit of a challenge &#8211; our machine is only so big, so we had to build the sign in multiple pieces. We used pallet wood for this project, cut down to size, then attached each board with pocket screws. From there, we applied a tea staining technique to antique the wood and give it a rough look. By using the pocket screws, we were able to take the sign apart as needed and fit into our machine. So we were able to separate the sign in 4 separate sections and engrave each separately and then when reattached, have a seamless transition as if the entire sign was engraved in one piece. We were very happy with the results and so was the customer. Glitter &amp; Whiskey Events has since been rebranded as Black Label Events.</p>
